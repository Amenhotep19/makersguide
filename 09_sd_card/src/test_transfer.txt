Test transfer document.  Used to see if the data transfer from
the host computer can get to the MCU and back again OK.

This file is big enough to use both of the two RAM buffers that are
256kb each.  

This newlines in this file are in PC format. The handling of newlines
are not consistent across PC, Linux, Mac, and not even across terminal
programs that you may encounter.  In my case, I have to add \r to every
\n when I print information to TeraTerm.  Yet, I have to add \n to every 
\r if the data originates on LEUART coming from TeraTerm.  I have not
handled it very completely in my code.

That is all.  Have a good time with your EFM32 Starter Kit
and The Maker's Guide to the IoT!!
